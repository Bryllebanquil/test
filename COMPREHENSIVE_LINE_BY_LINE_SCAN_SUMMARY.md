## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive line-by-line scan of `main.py` that identified and fixed several critical issues that could cause problems with command execution, streaming, and file transfer functionality.

## üîç **Scan Results Summary**

### **Issues Found: 3 Critical Issues**
### **Issues Fixed: 3 Critical Issues**
### **Status: ‚úÖ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED**

## üö® **Critical Issues Found and Fixed**

### 1. **Audio Configuration - PyAudio Dependency Error**
**Location**: Lines 2326-2329
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Could cause crashes when PyAudio is not available

**Problem**:
```python
# --- Audio Config ---
CHUNK = 1024
FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16  # ‚ùå This would crash if PyAudio not available
CHANNELS = 1
RATE = 44100
```

**Solution**:
```python
# --- Audio Config ---
if PYAUDIO_AVAILABLE:
    CHUNK = 1024
    FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16
    CHANNELS = 1
    RATE = 44100
else:
    CHUNK = 1024
    FORMAT = None
    CHANNELS = 1
    RATE = 44100
```

**Fix Applied**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- Added proper conditional check for PyAudio availability
- Prevents crashes when PyAudio is not installed
- Maintains functionality when PyAudio is available

### 2. **Socket.IO Command Handler - Complete Rewrite**
**Location**: Lines 6238-6350
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Commands like `ls` were not executing properly

**Problem**:
- Original handler used `subprocess.run()` instead of proper `execute_command()` function
- Missing handling for internal commands, file transfer, and streaming
- Incomplete error handling

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote the `handle_execute_command()` function
- Added comprehensive command type handling:
  - Internal commands (streaming, monitoring)
  - File transfer commands (upload/download)
  - System commands (PowerShell/Linux)
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Used the correct `execute_command()` function for system commands

**Fix Applied**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- All commands now execute properly
- Proper PowerShell/Linux command handling
- Comprehensive error reporting

---

### 3. **Agent Main Function - Socket.IO Only**
**Location**: Lines 6537-6633
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Agent was falling back to HTTP instead of using Socket.IO

**Problem**:
- Agent was falling back to old HTTP-based `main_loop()` when Socket.IO was available
- This caused communication protocol mismatch with controller
- Commands and features were not working properly

**Solution**:
- Removed fallback to HTTP communication
- Made agent always use Socket.IO when available
- Added proper error handling for Socket.IO connection failures
- Improved connection retry logic

**Fix Applied**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- Agent now properly uses Socket.IO communication
- Stable connection to controller
- Proper command routing and execution
