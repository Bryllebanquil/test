# PowerShell Download Fix

## Problem Description

The original PowerShell command was failing:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bryllebanquil/test/main/main.py" -OutFile "C:/c.py"
```

The command would show "Executing..." but no file would be created in the C:/ directory.

## Root Causes

1. **No Error Handling**: If the URL doesn't exist or network fails, the command hangs without feedback
2. **Progress Bar Issues**: Some PowerShell versions have issues with progress bars in non-interactive mode
3. **Parsing Issues**: Some environments require the `-UseBasicParsing` flag
4. **No Verification**: No way to confirm if the download actually succeeded

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved PowerShell Command

The improved command includes proper error handling:

```powershell
try {
    $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bryllebanquil/test/main/main.py" -OutFile "C:/c.py" -UseBasicParsing
    Write-Host "Download completed successfully to: C:/c.py"
} catch {
    Write-Host "Download failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    exit 1
}
```

### 2. Multiple Download Methods

The `main.py` file now includes multiple download methods:

- **Python requests**: Direct HTTP download using Python
- **PowerShell**: Improved PowerShell command with error handling
- **Fallback methods**: curl/wget for non-Windows systems

### 3. New Commands Added

#### Test Command
```
test-powershell-download
```
This command tests the download functionality with the specific URL mentioned in the issue.

#### URL Download Command
```
download-url:https://example.com/file.txt:C:/destination.txt
```
This command downloads a file from any URL to a specified destination.

## Usage Examples

### In the Agent

1. **Test the download functionality**:
   ```
   test-powershell-download
   ```

2. **Download a specific file**:
   ```
   download-url:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bryllebanquil/test/main/main.py:C:/c.py
   ```

3. **Download any file from URL**:
   ```
   download-url:https://example.com/somefile.txt:C:/downloads/file.txt
   ```

### Direct PowerShell Usage

If you want to use the improved PowerShell command directly:

```powershell
try {
    $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bryllebanquil/test/main/main.py" -OutFile "C:/c.py" -UseBasicParsing
    Write-Host "Download completed successfully to: C:/c.py"
} catch {
    Write-Host "Download failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    exit 1
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks provide clear error messages
2. **Progress Control**: `$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'` prevents progress bar issues
3. **Parsing Flag**: `-UseBasicParsing` ensures compatibility
4. **Verification**: File existence is checked after download
5. **Multiple Methods**: Fallback options if one method fails
6. **Timeout Protection**: Commands have timeout limits to prevent hanging

## Testing

You can test the fix using the provided test scripts:

1. **simple_test.py**: Tests the PowerShell commands directly
2. **test_download.py**: Comprehensive test with multiple methods

## Files Modified

- `main.py`: Added download functions and command handlers
- `simple_test.py`: Test script for PowerShell commands
- `test_download.py`: Comprehensive test script
- `DOWNLOAD_FIX_README.md`: This documentation

## Troubleshooting

If downloads still fail:

1. **Check URL**: Ensure the URL is accessible and returns content
2. **Check Permissions**: Ensure write permissions to the destination directory
3. **Check Network**: Verify internet connectivity
4. **Check Antivirus**: Some antivirus software may block downloads
5. **Try Different Method**: Use the Python requests method if PowerShell fails

## Security Notes

- The download functions include basic path validation
- File size limits can be implemented if needed
- Consider adding URL whitelisting for production use
- Downloaded files should be scanned for malware before execution
